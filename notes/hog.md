# Introduction to HOG and SVM in OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library aimed at real-time computer vision. Two important concepts within OpenCV are the **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, which are often used together for tasks like object detection, especially pedestrian detection.

---

## Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

### What is HOG?

The **Histogram of Oriented Gradients** is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing. It captures the edge or gradient structure of objects within an image, which is particularly useful for object recognition tasks.

### How Does HOG Work?

1. **Gradient Computation**: The image is first divided into small connected regions called cells, and for each cell, the gradient magnitude and direction are calculated.

2. **Orientation Binning**: The gradients are quantized into orientation bins, typically 9 bins spanning 0 to 180 degrees (unsigned gradients).

3. **Descriptor Blocks**: Cells are grouped into larger blocks (usually consisting of 2Ã—2 cells), and the histograms within these blocks are normalized to account for variations in illumination and contrast.

4. **Feature Vector**: The normalized histograms from all blocks are concatenated to form the final feature vector representing the image.

### Applications of HOG

- **Pedestrian Detection**: HOG descriptors are widely used for detecting humans in images and videos due to their ability to capture the human shape effectively.

- **Object Recognition**: Useful in various object detection tasks where shape and edge information are crucial.

- **Image Classification**: HOG features can be input to machine learning algorithms for classifying images based on their content.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### What is SVM?

**Support Vector Machine** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates data into classes by maximizing the margin between different classes.

### How Does SVM Work?

- **Hyperplane Selection**: SVM identifies the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. In higher dimensions, this hyperplane becomes a hyperplane (an n-1 dimensional subspace).

- **Support Vectors**: The data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors, and they influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane.

- **Kernel Trick**: For non-linearly separable data, SVM can use kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to project data into higher dimensions where a linear separation is possible.

### Applications of SVM

- **Classification Tasks**: Widely used for binary and multi-class classification problems in various domains.

- **Object Detection**: In computer vision, SVMs are used to classify HOG features to detect objects within images.

- **Face Recognition**: SVMs can classify facial features for recognition systems.

## Combining HOG and SVM in OpenCV

The combination of HOG descriptors and SVM classifiers is a powerful technique for object detection tasks. The general workflow involves:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Use HOG to extract features from images.

2. **Training**: Train an SVM classifier using the extracted HOG features.

3. **Detection**: Use the trained SVM to detect objects in new images by classifying the HOG features.

## OpenCV API: Basic Objects and Methods

### HOG Descriptor in OpenCV

**Class:** `cv2.HOGDescriptor`

**Constructor:**

- `hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()`
  - Initializes a new instance with default parameters or custom parameters.

**Key Methods:**

- `setSVMDetector(svm_detector)`
  - Sets the coefficients of the trained SVM classifier.
  - For pedestrian detection, you can use the pre-trained detector provided by OpenCV.

- `detect(img[, hitThreshold[, winStride[, padding[, locations[, weights]]]]])`
  - Detects objects in an image and returns their locations and confidence scores.

- `detectMultiScale(img[, hitThreshold[, winStride[, padding[, scale[, finalThreshold[, useMeanshiftGrouping]]]]]])`
  - Detects objects at multiple scales in the image.

- `compute(img[, winStride[, padding[, locations]]])`
  - Computes the HOG descriptors for a given image or region.

**Usage Example in Python:**

Below is an example of using HOG and SVM for pedestrian detection.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Initialize HOG descriptor
hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()

# Set the SVM detector to the default pre-trained pedestrian detector
hog.setSVMDetector(cv2.HOGDescriptor_getDefaultPeopleDetector())

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Resize image to improve processing speed and detection accuracy
image = cv2.resize(image, (640, 480))

# Detect pedestrians
(rects, weights) = hog.detectMultiScale(
    image,
    winStride=(8, 8),
    padding=(8, 8),
    scale=1.05
)

# Draw bounding boxes
for (x, y, w, h) in rects:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display result
cv2.imshow('Pedestrian Detection', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**
  - We create an instance of `cv2.HOGDescriptor()`.
  - We set the SVM detector to the default people detector using `cv2.HOGDescriptor_getDefaultPeopleDetector()`, which loads a pre-trained SVM classifier optimized for pedestrian detection.

- **Image Loading and Preprocessing:**
  - The image is loaded using `cv2.imread()`.
  - Resizing the image can improve processing speed and sometimes detection accuracy.

- **Detection:**
  - We use `hog.detectMultiScale()` to detect objects at multiple scales.
    - **winStride**: The step size in pixels for moving the detection window across the image. Smaller values increase computation time but may improve accuracy.
    - **padding**: The number of pixels to pad around the detection window.
    - **scale**: The factor by which the detection window is scaled per iteration. A value close to 1.0 increases the number of scales and computation time.
  - The function returns rectangles (`rects`) where pedestrians are detected, and weights (`weights`) indicating the confidence.

- **Drawing Bounding Boxes:**
  - We iterate over the detected rectangles and draw bounding boxes around the detected pedestrians using `cv2.rectangle()`.

- **Display:**
  - The resulting image is displayed using `cv2.imshow()`.

### Support Vector Machine in OpenCV

**Class:** `cv2.ml.SVM`

**Creating an Instance:**

- `svm = cv2.ml.SVM_create()`
  - Creates an empty SVM model.

**Key Methods:**

- `train(trainData, flags=0)`
  - Trains the SVM model using the training data.

- `predict(samples[, results[, flags]])`
  - Predicts responses for input samples.

- `save(filename)`
  - Saves the trained SVM model to a file.

- `load(filename)`
  - Loads a pre-trained SVM model from a file.

- `setType()`, `setKernel()`, `setC()`, etc.
  - Set various SVM parameters:
    - `setType()`: Sets the type of SVM (e.g., `cv2.ml.SVM_C_SVC`).
    - `setKernel()`: Sets the kernel type (e.g., `cv2.ml.SVM_LINEAR`).
    - `setC()`: Sets the penalty parameter C of the error term.

**Usage Example in Python:**

Here's an example of training an SVM classifier using HOG features extracted from images.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
from glob import glob

# Initialize HOG descriptor
hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()

# Prepare training data
positive_images = glob('path_to_positive_images/*.jpg')
negative_images = glob('path_to_negative_images/*.jpg')

train_data = []
labels = []

# Extract HOG features from positive samples (e.g., images containing pedestrians)
for img_path in positive_images:
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (64, 128))  # Standard HOG window size
    descriptors = hog.compute(img)
    train_data.append(descriptors)
    labels.append(1)  # Positive class label

# Extract HOG features from negative samples (e.g., images without pedestrians)
for img_path in negative_images:
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (64, 128))
    descriptors = hog.compute(img)
    train_data.append(descriptors)
    labels.append(-1)  # Negative class label

# Convert training data and labels to the appropriate format
train_data = np.array(train_data, dtype=np.float32)
train_data = train_data.squeeze()
labels = np.array(labels, dtype=np.int32)

# Create an SVM instance
svm = cv2.ml.SVM_create()

# Set SVM parameters
svm.setType(cv2.ml.SVM_C_SVC)
svm.setKernel(cv2.ml.SVM_LINEAR)
svm.setC(0.01)

# Train the SVM
svm.train(train_data, cv2.ml.ROW_SAMPLE, labels)

# Save the trained model
svm.save('hog_svm_model.yml')

# Now, to use the trained SVM for detection, we can set the SVM detector in the HOG descriptor
# First, get the support vectors and convert them to the format expected by HOGDescriptor

# Get the support vectors
alpha = np.zeros((1))
rho = svm.getDecisionFunction(0, alpha)
support_vectors = svm.getSupportVectors()

# Compute the detector coefficients
svm_detector = -support_vectors[0]  # Negative as per OpenCV's implementation
svm_detector = np.append(svm_detector, rho)

# Set the SVM detector in the HOG descriptor
hog.setSVMDetector(svm_detector)

# Now you can use hog.detectMultiScale() as before
```

**Explanation:**

- **Data Preparation:**
  - **Positive Samples**: Images containing the object of interest (e.g., pedestrians).
  - **Negative Samples**: Images without the object.
  - We extract HOG descriptors from each image and label them accordingly.

- **Training Data Formatting:**
  - The extracted descriptors are added to `train_data`.
  - Labels are added to `labels`.
  - We convert `train_data` to a NumPy array and reshape it appropriately using `squeeze()`.

- **SVM Training:**
  - We set the SVM parameters using `setType()`, `setKernel()`, and `setC()`.
  - We train the SVM using `svm.train()`.

- **Model Saving:**
  - We save the trained SVM model using `svm.save()`.

- **Setting the SVM Detector:**
  - We retrieve the support vectors and compute the detector coefficients.
  - We set the SVM detector in the HOG descriptor using `hog.setSVMDetector(svm_detector)`.

- **Detection:**
  - Now we can use `hog.detectMultiScale()` to detect objects using our custom-trained SVM.
